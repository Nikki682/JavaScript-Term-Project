Project name: Big Top
The audience is for most people willing to play a small browser game, as well as any circus enthusiests. 
The menu screen layout is interactice when hovering on a link to a choosen game. Game choices are laid out like a 3 ring circus 
with lots of red and yellow. 

clicking a game brings you to a the game screen where the themes vary from game to game but
have a dark feel like before the spotlight shines on the main event, with or without the drapery.
I feel this adds to the user experience.

First Game Jigsaw Just a drag and Drop game. Put the pictures together correctly to make the complete picture.

Coding issues. All of them. Flexbox trouble, getting the pieces sized right, and positioning of everything.
Still need mobile friendly, a timer for scoring and an event when the puzzle is completed correctly, as well as a reset button.
